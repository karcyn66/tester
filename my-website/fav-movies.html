	<p>I have a top 4 favorite movies. My first one is the Outiders. We read about it and wathced the movie in language arts. My second favorite movie is probably Avatar: The Way of Water. I watched it in the theatre and it was so good. I think i like it better than the first one. My third one is Top Gun: Maverick. It used to be my favorite and it still is but not as much as the other two. My last one is the Harry Potter series. I'm reading the books right now but I already wathced all the movies.</p>
